I studied Korean Language & Literature and Mathematics and dreamed of becoming a musician before becoming a developer. Although these are different fields, they all share a common characteristic - they are all languages of sorts. I believe code is not written for computers to read, but for humans to read. I also think that an engineer's job is not to create programs, but to create code. That's why I work with 'readability' as a priority. Through readable code, I have been recognized at the companies I've worked for not only as someone who communicates well with developers, but also as someone who communicates most clearly with non-developers.

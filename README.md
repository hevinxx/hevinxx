**Android Developer | 2018~**

> I studied Korean Literature and Mathematics, dreamed of becoming a musician, and then became a developer.
> These fields may seem different, but they share one thing in common: they are all languages.
> I believe code is written for humans to read, not for computers.
> I write readable code to communicate with developers, and I'm known for communicating clearly with non-developers as well.
